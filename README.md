## Guidelines for contributors 📏 📐
<b>ONLY STUDENTS OF DEPARTMENT OF CSE, DIU</b>

We welcome contributions to improve and enhance DIU-CP. Before contributing, please take a moment to review the following guidelines: ⤵️

### Contribution Guidelines 📑

1. **Fork the Repository:** If you want to contribute, start by forking the repository on GitHub.

2. **Branching:** Create a new branch for your contribution. This helps keep your changes isolated.

3. **Code Style:** Follow the existing code style and structure to maintain consistency. Add meaningful comments with your code so that other developers can understand the purpose. Prefer using built-in methods and libraries over creating your own if they are available. Utilize the technology that is already in use. For instance, avoid replacing React with PHP and creating a new solution. We trust that the current technology can effectively address the problem. 

4. **Commit Messages:** Write clear and concise commit messages, explaining the purpose of your changes. Do not push all of your solution in a single commit. Use multiple commits for multiple solutions. This helps to identify any bug in a version.

5. **Pull Requests:** Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes and the problem it solves.

6. **Testing:** Ensure that your changes have been thoroughly tested before submitting a pull request.

9. **DIU Dept CSE Students Only:** Please note that we currently only accept contributions from students of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Dhaka International University.

10. **Be Respectful:** Be courteous and respectful towards other contributors and maintainers. We encourage a positive and inclusive community.

We will review your solution as soon as possible and give you a feedback. 🔥
